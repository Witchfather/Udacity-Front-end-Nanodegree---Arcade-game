Front-end Nanodegree Arcade Game Project
===============================

*Summary:*
The objective of the game is to make the player move over to the water tiles, moving through the gray road tiles while avoiding the enemy bugs. Any collision with the bugs and the player results in the game being reset and the player losing a life. The player has three lives and the remaining lives are indicated at the bottom of the canvas. The grass tiles and water tiles are safe, while the road tiles are unsafe for the player.

*Controls:*
Use the arrow keys to move the player up, down, right and left to move him over to the water tiles. Once the player reaches there, he wins the game.
